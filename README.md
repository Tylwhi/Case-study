* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

>It started as the ripple project in 2004, created by Ryan Fugger, which had the idea of creating a person to person exchange of credits/IOU's that was non-profit. Later in 2011, Ryan Fugger, Chris Larsen, and Jeb Meccaleb came together to make an algorithm like bitcoin but was more efficient and used less electricity. They took the idea from the ripple project and tied it into the algorithm which became the base of ripple. Soon after the technology was stable enough, they declared a coin that was called XRP, and a company that would advocate and focus on the ecosystem.

>Ripples intended customers would be entities or institutions that transfers money or funds across each other. The market size can be limitless, anyone that wants to trade with it can and has the access to do so. Ripple is cheaper and more efficient than bitcoin, which uses more elericity and is more wasteful.
